# Habits

I made this project with React. This is a website so users can track their daily habits.
The user just needs to type their habit. And once they have completed it click on it again to delete it.
If the user does not delete the habit it will stay there until the user does so. 

I used mongoose as the database, and I made a resfulAPI to connect it with the front-end.
