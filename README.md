This Application is to Track your habits daily. I usually use my notes and write down what my habits are for the day, I don't add things like a To-Do list. This is just habits that I already have or I'm working on, bad or good. You just type it out, and add it and at the end of the day if you completed it you'd click on it and it'll get erased from the DB. If you do not complete it then you would not click on it and the next day it'll still be there. 
This works well as a reminded of what you didn't do the previous day.

To use this application you need to download the HabitsAPI and run that first using node since the API is what connects this project with the DB.
